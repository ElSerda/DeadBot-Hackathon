## Before You Start
Make sure you have:
- Windows PC
- Visual Studio 2022
- G-Assist installed on your system
- Basic knowledge of C++

ðŸ’¡ **Tip**: This template is designed to be modular - you can easily add your own features while maintaining compatibility with G-Assist!

## Installation Guide

### Step 1: Get the Files
```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules <repository-url>
cd cpp-template
```
This downloads the template and all necessary files to your computer.

### Step 2: Get Required Dependencies
Download [JSON for Modern C++ v3.11.3](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/releases/download/v3.11.3/include.zip)

### Step 3: Set Up Dependencies
```bash
# Extract JSON library
mkdir json && tar -xf path\to\include.zip -C json
```

### Step 4: Build It
1. Open the solution in Visual Studio 2022
2. Select your build configuration (Debug/Release)
3. Build the solution (F7 or Build â†’ Build Solution)

### Step 5: Install the Plugin
1. Create this folder (if it doesn't exist):
   ```
   %PROGRAMDATA%\NVIDIA Corporation\nvtopps\rise\adapters\myplugin
   ```
   ðŸ’¡ **Tip**: Copy and paste this path directly into File Explorer's address bar!

2. Copy these files to the folder you just created:
   - `cpp-template.exe` (from your build output folder)
   - `manifest.json` (from project root)

## How to Customize
Start customizing your plugin by:
- Modifying the command handlers in `commands.cpp`
- Adding your own features in new source files
- Updating `manifest.json` with your plugin's information
- Implementing your own response logic

ðŸ’¡ **Tip**: Check out our other plugin examples to see how to implement specific features!

## Troubleshooting Tips
- **Build failing?** Make sure JSON library is extracted to the correct location
- **Plugin not loading?** Double-check the installation folder path
- **Commands not working?** Verify your manifest.json is properly configured
- **Compilation errors?** Make sure all required headers are included
